# Hidden Markov Models

## Task 0

<details>
    <summary> Instructions</summary>

Write the function `def markov_chain(P, s, t=1):` that determines the probability of a markov chain being in a particular state after a specified number of iterations:

`P` is a square 2D numpy.ndarray of shape `(n, n)` representing the transition matrix

`P[i, j]` is the probability of transitioning from state i to state j
`n` is the number of states in the markov chain

* `s` is a numpy.ndarray of shape `(1, n)` representing the probability of starting in each state

* `t` is the number of iterations that the markov chain has been through

Returns: a `numpy.ndarray` of shape `(1, n)` representing the probability of being in a specific state after `t` iterations, or `None` on failure


</details>

You'll be able to find the chance of any given position via dot product of `s` and `P`.

    Write the function def regular(P): that determines the steady state probabilities of a regular markov chain:

P is a is a square 2D numpy.ndarray of shape (n, n) representing the transition matrix
P[i, j] is the probability of transitioning from state i to state j
n is the number of states in the markov chain
Returns: a numpy.ndarray of shape (1, n) containing the steady state probabilities, or None on failure

Steady State is the term used in the curriculum, but [it seems to be the same as](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/9325/equilibrium-distribution-steady-state-distribution-stationary-distribution-and) "equilibrium" and "stationary" states.

Steady state (stationary [in this text](https://towardsdatascience.com/markov-chain-analysis-and-simulation-using-python-4507cee0b06e)) is referred to as `pi` or `Ï€` and equals:

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52137856/steady-state-probabilities-markov-chain-python-implementation) is one python code application example I found.
