* For a refresher on basic Pythonic classes, see [my previous repository explaining the subject](https://github.com/Jabulani-N/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/python-classes).

# Task0

This is essentially a refresher on basic Pythonic techniques.

For a no-spoilers sight of properly documented modules and classses, one can reference [one of my previous tutorial projects](https://github.com/Jabulani-N/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/1-rectangle.py)


# Task1

Changes Task0 attributes from public to private.

Create getters for affected attributes.

* [Example](https://github.com/Jabulani-N/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/7-rectangle.py)

# Taask2

Use sigmoid function on the *weighted* input array.

* multiply weights array with input array.

Incredible as always, [numpy has a tool](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.exp.html) to find `e` of an array
