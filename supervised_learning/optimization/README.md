Though standard deviation and mean are values we calculated in the [math](https://github.com/Jabulani-N/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/math/probability) course, because numpy is availible this course, we can directly have it calculate [mean](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html) and [standard deviation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.std.html.
