## Abstract

Following guidance of multiple sources, I imported the EfficientNetB7 Keras model, and manipulated parameters in order to create a new model to identify the CIFAR10 Dataset. The top layer was not imported. A new top layer was created. Techniques utilized include Dropout and Data Augmentation. Early Stopping is utilized to limit wasted resources.
