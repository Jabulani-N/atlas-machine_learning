Write a function def bag_of_words(sentences, vocab=None): that creates a bag of words embedding matrix:

sentences is a list of sentences to analyze
vocab is a list of the vocabulary words to use for the analysis
If None, all words within sentences should be used
Returns: embeddings, features

embeddings is a numpy.ndarray of shape (s, f) containing the embeddings
s is the number of sentences in sentences
f is the number of features analyzed
features is a list of the features used for embeddings
You are not allowed to use genism library.
