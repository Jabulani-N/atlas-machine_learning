# QA Bot

This question and answer bot will ask for questions and answer with an answer. It'll also exit when told things like `"bye"` â˜†


It pulls information from [a stack of Zendesk articles](./data/ZendeskArticles/) outlining Holberton School's curriculum rules and answers questions about it. Questions that cannot be answered are answered with `Sorry, I do not understand your question.`
