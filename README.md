# atlas-machine_learning

Atlas School's Machine Learning (ML) specialization.
This organization is a name and owner change of Holberton School, referenced in my preceding repositories.

Much of the work done in this repository is the creation python functions that demonstrate the manners by which various machine learning tools function. It follows a "data scientist's" approach to learning, as it shows my learning of how the modules do their work.


# [Math](./math/)

The **Math** directory was created to practice and review a number of calculus techniques used in ML libraries.

# [Supervised Learning](./supervised_learning/)

The **Supervised Learning** directory beigns with introductions to various concepts of ML that are done "supervised" by a human and, as of more recent work, features directories demonstrating the utilization of ML Python modules in order to evaluate or create ML models.

# [Unsupervised Learning](./unsupervised_learning/)

**Unsupervised Learning** contains my learning of ML that is not evaluated by a human, instead using structures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to use "correct" data as a guide in learning to generate "realistic" data
